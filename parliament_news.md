Sisters-in-law: Australian Parliament's important role in advancing gender equality

Goodwill and gradual attitudinal change about the role of women in our society is not sufficient to achieve gender equality. In this lecture Kate Jenkins will discuss how the Australian Parliament has played a vital role over the last 50 years in turning that momentum for social change into enforceable laws that are globally recognised as effective and leading.

Kate Jenkins AO is a leader, lawyer and change-maker renowned as Australia's foremost authority on respect and inclusion in Australian workplaces, parliament, sport, the arts, security forces and education.

Kate is Chair of the Australian Sports Commission, Chair of the Creative Workplaces Council and President of the Australian Red Cross.

In her previous role as Australian Sex Discrimination Commissioner, Kate is perhaps best known around Australian Parliament House for her landmark Respect@Work report and her leadership of the Independent Review of Commonwealth Parliamentary Workplaces in 2021 (Set the Standard).

Kate's previous roles include Victorian Equal Opportunity and Human Rights Commissioner, employment law partner at Herbert Smith Freehills and serving on the boards of Berry Street Victoria, Heide Museum of Modern Art, Play by the Rules and Carlton Football Club.

Senator Sue Lines was first elected President of the Senate at the opening of the 47th Parliament in 2022, marking a significant milestone in her career as a Senator representing Western Australia since 2013. Notably, she is the first female Labor President of the Senate and the second only female President after Liberal Senator Margaret Reid in 1996. In her time in the Senate she has represented Australia at the United Nations Women's Forum in New York City, delivered statements as national delegation leader at the Women Political Leaders Reykjavik Global Forum and has produced reports calling for gender equality at the Inter-Parliamentary Union and Commonwealth Parliamentary Association.
