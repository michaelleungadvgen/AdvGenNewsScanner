## 1. Queensland Health News Scraper Demo

**Date:** 2025-08-20

**Source:** [https://www.health.qld.gov.au/newsroom/news](https://www.health.qld.gov.au/newsroom/news)

**Summary:** This is a demonstration of the Queensland Health news scraper. The actual website appears to block automated requests.

### Content

This scraper was designed to extract news content from the Queensland Health newsroom.

However, the website appears to implement bot protection that returns a 403 Forbidden error when accessed programmatically.

Alternative approaches that could be tried:
- Using a headless browser like Selenium
- Looking for RSS feeds or API endpoints
- Requesting permission from Queensland Health for automated access
- Using proxy services or different IP addresses

The scraper includes comprehensive functionality for:
- Extracting article links from listing pages
- Parsing individual article content
- Cleaning and formatting text
- Generating structured markdown output
- Handling various HTML structures and selectors

**Summary:** Guidelines for responsible web scraping and handling access restrictions.

### Content

When encountering access restrictions while web scraping:

1. **Respect robots.txt**: Always check the site's robots.txt file
2. **Rate limiting**: Include delays between requests
3. **User agents**: Use appropriate user agent strings
4. **Error handling**: Implement robust error handling
5. **Alternative sources**: Look for RSS feeds or APIs
6. **Legal compliance**: Ensure scraping complies with terms of service
7. **Contact site owners**: Request permission for automated access

This scraper demonstrates these principles while providing a framework that can be adapted when access is available.
