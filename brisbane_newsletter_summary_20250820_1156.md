Busting congestion in the suburbs Brisbane is one of Australia’s fastest-growing cities. This growth is both a challenge and an opportunity.

With almost 130,000 vehicles using this route on weekdays, better planning could help bust congestion and make it easier for you to get where you need to be sooner and safer.
